        How to Play
      </h1>

      <section class="space-y-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          In turns, a player picks up all the BEADs from any of the holes on
          their side of the board and redistributes them one BEAD per hole in a
          counter-clockwise direction, including onto spaces on their opponent’s
          side of the board.
        </p>

        <p>
          Captures happen when the play space next to the last BEAD
          redistributed is empty. The player captures all the BEADs in the hole
          after the empty hole, and all the BEADs in the space opposite the hole
          BEADs were captured from.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the space next to the last BEAD redistributed is empty and at the
          end of a row, the player will have only one pit to capture BEADs from.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a capture cannot be made, the same player starts redistributing
          BEADs from the next play space and continues in the same direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          If while distributing the BEADs the total number in a hole becomes 4,
          the player captures them (respectively to their side).
        </p>

        <p>
          After the second redistribution, the turn is over regardless of
          whether a player has made a capture or not.
        </p>

        <p>Play continues until all the BEADs have been captured.</p>

          History
        </h2>
        <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
          Ali Guli Mane is an abstract strategy board game of the mancala
          family, originating from Karnataka in South India. The name of the
          game, like many other mancala games across the world, simply describes
          the board used: it means a "wooden block with holes".
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
          It is similar to Pallanguzhi from the neighbouring state of Tamil
          Nadu. There are also similarities with the traditional Indonesian
          Mancala game Congkak.
