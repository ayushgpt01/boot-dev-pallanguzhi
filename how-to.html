    <section class="space-y-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">
      <p>In turns, a player picks up all the BEADs from any of the holes on their side of the board and redistributes them one BEAD per hole 
    in a counter-clockwise direction, including onto spaces on their opponent’s side of the board.</p>

    <p>Captures happen when the play space next to the last BEAD redistributed is empty. The player captures all the BEADs in the hole after 
    the empty hole, and all the BEADs in the space opposite the hole BEADs were captured from.</p>

  <p>If the space next to the last BEAD redistributed is empty and at the end of a row, the player will have only one pit to capture BEADs
     from.</p>

  <p>If a capture cannot be made, the same player starts redistributing BEADs from the next play space and continues in the same direction.</p>

  <p>If while distributing the BEADs the total number in a hole becomes 4, the player captures them (respectively to their side).</p>

  <p>After the second redistribution, the turn is over regardless of whether a player has made a capture or not.</p>

  <p>Play continues until all the BEADs have been captured.</p>

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">Ali Guli Mane is an abstract strategy board game of the mancala family, originating from Karnataka in South India. The name of the game, like many other mancala games across the world, simply describes the board used: it means a "wooden block with holes".</p>

      <p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-relaxed">It is similar to Pallanguzhi from the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. There are also similarities with the traditional Indonesian Mancala game Congkak.</p>
